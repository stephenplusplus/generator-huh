# generator-huh [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stephenplusplus/generator-huh.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stephenplusplus/generator-huh)

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator to help you learn new things.

# Installation & Usage
```sh
$ npm install --global generator-huh
$ yo huh
```

# In Development
The idea with `huh`, is to give developers a command-line reference book and learning assistant. Web development has been getting increasingly difficult to keep up with. This tool will try to help serve as a quick helper for questions like:

- What is gulp.js?
- Who is using Ember?
- What is React?
- ??

Since we're in the terminal, we can do cool stuff, like:

- Use Yeoman to generate a React app.
- ??

Please, if you have ideas for this generator, open an issue, or just send them on through. I would love to see contributions of any size.
